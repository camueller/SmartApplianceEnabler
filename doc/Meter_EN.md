# Meter
To configure a meter, the type of meter must be selected in the `Type` selection box:
- [S0](S0Meter_EN.md)
- [HTTP](HttpMeter_EN.md)
- [Modbus](ModbusMeter_EN.md) only appears if at least one Modbus has been configured in the [Settings](Settings_EN.md#modbus).
- [Master/Slave meter](MasterSlaveMeter_EN.md)

According to this selection, the fields that can be configured for the selected meter type are displayed.

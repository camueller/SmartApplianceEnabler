# Meter

To configure a counter, the type of counter must be selected in the `Type` selection box:

* [S0](SOMeter_EN.md)
* [HTTP](HttpMeter_EN.md)
* [Modbus](ModbusMeter_EN.md) only appears if at least one Modbus has been configured in the [Settings](Settings_EN.md#user-content-modbus).
* [Master/Slave meter](MasterSlaveMeter_EN.md)

According to this selection, the fields that can be configured for the selected counter type are displayed.

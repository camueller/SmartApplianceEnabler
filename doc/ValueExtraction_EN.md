# Value extraction
In the case of queries, the *Smart Appliance Enabler* often receives a comprehensive response (XML, JSON, ...) from which the numerical value actually required must first be extracted.

For this purpose, either a (JSON) path (field name `Path for extraction`) or a regular expression (field name `Regex for extraction`) can be configured at various points in the *Smart Appliance Enabler*.

## Using JSON path
This value extraction method only works if the response is in JSON format!

Whether a response is in JSON format can be seen relatively easily from the curly brackets, which determine its structure.

To determine the JSON path, it helps if you format the JSON response in such a way that the structure is recognizable. For example, [JSON Pretty Print](https://jsonformatter.org/json-pretty-print) is suitable for this, where you enter the unformatted JSON response in the left half of the browser (can be taken from the log if the *Smart Appliance Enabler* already communicated with this device):
```json
{"StatusSNS":{"Time":"2019-09-06T20:06:19","ENERGY":{"TotalStartTime":"2019-08-18T11:07:55","Total":0.003,"Yesterday":0.000,"Today":0.003,"Power":26,"ApparentPower":25,"ReactivePower":25,"Factor":0.06,"Voltage":239,"Current":0.106}}}
```
If you then press `Make Pretty`, you get the nicely formatted JSON in the right half of the browser:
```json
{
  "StatusSNS": {
    "Time": "2019-09-06T20:06:19",
    "ENERGY": {
      "TotalStartTime": "2019-08-18T11:07:55",
      "Total": 0.003,
      "Yesterday": 0,
      "Today": 0.003,
      "Power": 26,
      "ApparentPower": 25,
      "ReactivePower": 25,
      "Factor": 0.06,
      "Voltage": 239,
      "Current": 0.106
    }
  }
}
```
Each last entry is relevant for the path to the desired value before the indentation depth increases. These entries are lined up and separated by a period. At the end of this path there must be the name whose value is to be extracted.

For the "Power" value, the path results accordingly as:
`StatusSNS.ENERGY.Power`

When configuring the path in the *Smart Appliance Enabler*, this path must be preceded by a `$.`, i.e. for the example above, the following must be configured in the *Smart Appliance Enabler*:

`Extraction path`: `$.StatusSNS.ENERGY.Power`

In order for the *Smart Appliance Enabler* to know that the response should be interpreted as JSON, `JSON` must also be specified as `Format`!

## Using regular expression (aka regex)

Value extraction with a [Regular Expression](http://www.regexe.de/hilfe.jsp) always works. However, their formulation is not immediately clear to everyone.

This [Java Regex Tester](https://www.freeformatter.com/java-regex-tester.html) can be used to test whether the selected regular expression extracts the desired value from the response.

In addition to the regular expression, you need the answer from which the value is to be extracted. If the *Smart Appliance Enabler* is already communicating with this device, its response can be found in the log.

The names shown in italics refer to the corresponding fields on the Regex Tester page.

_Java Regular Expression_: `.*"Power":(\d+).*`

_Entry to test against_
```json
{"StatusSNS":{"Time":"2019-09-06T20:06:19","ENERGY":{"TotalStartTime":"2019-08-18T11:07:55","Total":0.003,"Yesterday":0.000,"Today":0.003,"Power":26,"ApparentPower":25,"ReactivePower":25,"Factor":0.06,"Voltage":239,"Current":0.106}}}
```

_Replace with (Optional)_: `$1`

_Flags_: `[x] Dotall`

After clicking on `REPLACE FIRST` the following is displayed:

```
Results
.matches() method: true
.lookingAt() method: true
String replacement result:
26
```

So the value 26 was successfully extracted from the response using the regular expression above.

If a regular expression is configured, no value should be configured as `Format` in the *Smart Appliance Enabler*!

In the *Smart Appliance Enabler* the following must be configured for this example:

`Regex f√ºr Extraktion`: `.*"Power":(\d+).*`

`Format`: leer lassen

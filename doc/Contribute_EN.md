## Github
Everything that makes up the *Smart Appliance Enabler* is in a repository at Github: The program code, automated tests, images, documentation - including this page you are reading right now.

This inevitably means that you **have to create a Github account (it's free!)** if you don't have one yet.

The following steps all take place in the web browser - you don't have to install or run anything locally!

1. Create a copy ("fork") of the *Smart Appliance Enabler* repository (https://github.com/camueller/SmartApplianceEnabler) in your Github account
1. You can now make the actual changes or add new files to the files in this "forked" repository
1. Create a "Pull Request" to request that your changes be transferred to the original *Smart Appliance Enabler* repository

There is a very good video on this process:

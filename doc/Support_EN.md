# Paid support
The use of the *Smart Appliance Enabler* is free of charge and in [Github Discussions](https://github.com/camueller/SmartApplianceEnabler/discussions) questions (also from me) are answered free of charge. Nevertheless, it can be that you feel overwhelmed by the complexity of the technology, processes and dependencies. Or that you are not familiar with Linux and therefore hesitate to use the *Smart Appliance Enabler*. To support these users, I offer paid support.

## Preliminary talk (free)
The preliminary talk runs as a video chat, during which I can also present relevant pages of the *Smart Appliance Enabler* documentation or *Smart Appliance Enabler* web interface by sharing my screen. At the beginning, the user tells what he actually wants to achieve (I usually already know that from the posts in the forum) and I can already give initial answers or recommendations. As a developer of the *Smart Appliance Enabler*, I am of course familiar with the internal functionality and the interaction with the SMA world. Of course, I also use information that I have gained from supporting other users.

At the end of the preliminary discussion, we will discuss how to proceed in concrete terms.

## Software installation (chargeable)
The minimum requirement for support via the Internet is a Raspberry Pi installed according to the documentation. If desired, I can do this after an SD card and a postage-paid return envelope have been sent to me.

## Creating the conditions for support via the Internet
For support via the Internet, the user must set up port forwarding of any port to port 22 of the Raspberry Pi in his router so that I can access it via SSH (Secure Shell). I can only do that if I know the router's public IP address at the time. The user can tell me this or set up dynamic DNS on their router so that their IP address can be determined.

## Support (chargeable)
If the requirements (installed Raspbery Pi and working port forwarding) are met, the actual support can begin. This again runs as a video chat, whereby I share my screen while I connect to the user's Raspberry Pi via SSH. The user can see which commands I use to change the configuration of the Raspberry Pi, the *Smart Appliance Enabler* or the services used by it, to stop or start these services. Of course also analyzing log files to identify possible errors.

This approach has proven particularly useful for users who have little or no experience with Linux.

In this way, the user gets a working *Smart Appliance Enabler* installation as quickly as possible.

## Pricing
The paid support will be charged with

**65 Euro/hour incl. VAT**

which is roughly the amount that every plumbing/heating engineer bills. Since I know exactly what to do when it comes to installing and configuring the *Smart Appliance Enabler*, in most cases everything is already done in one or two hours.

[Please post requests for paid support in the relevant forum, including contact details](https://github.com/camueller/SmartApplianceEnabler/discussions/categories/anfragen-f%C3%BCr-kommerziellen-support). I will get back to you shortly. Once we have established another communication channel, you can delete the post here so that your contact details are no longer visible.

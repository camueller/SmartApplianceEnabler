**For several years I have put most of my free time into developing, documenting and supporting this open source project. I made a conscious decision to make this software available free of charge and to continuously expand it with features that could be of interest to as many users as possible. By using this software, electricity costs can be significantly reduced by maximizing the use of self-generated electricity. I would consider it an acknowledgment of my work if a portion of this saving were used to help support this project. This can easily be done using [Paypal](https://paypal.me/CarlAxelMueller) or bank transfer (account owner: Axel Mueller, IBAN: DE83 5185 0079 1140 0764 37, BIC: HELADEF1FRI, Details: support for Smart Appliance Enabler)**
<br><br>

# Overview
**The *Smart Appliance Enabler* is a software for integrating any device ([Wallbox](doc/EVCharger_EN.md), heat pump, washing machine, dishwasher, ...) with the [Sunny Home Manager](https://www.sma.de/produkte/monitoring-control/sunny-home-manager-20.html) by [SMA](http://www.sma.de) to **maximize the use of self-generated electricity obtained by photovoltaic systems**.**

![SmartHomeEnablerClip](pics/clip/SaeClip_EN.gif)

For that, the *Smart Appliance Enabler* reports **demands** of these devices to the *Sunny Home Manager* in order to enable optimal planning of self-consumption. According to this planning, the *Smart Appliance Enabler* receives **switching commands**, which it forwards to the devices it manages. If individual, **digital electricity meters** are used for these devices, the power cosumption can be read and reported to the *Sunny Home Manager* to support it in learning the consumption characteristics and visualize power consumption in the [Sunny Portal](https://www.sunnyportal.com/).

The following graphic from the [Sunny Portal](https://www.sunnyportal.com/) shows a sunny autumn day on which the [Wallbox](doc/EVCharger_EN.md) was optimally controlled to charge the electric car while avoiding grid purchase. At the same time, the *Sunny Home Manager* had to run the dishwasher and washing machine according to the set requirements. In addition, the heat pump (hot water and heating) and the espresso machine were switched on at times, which are not controlled by the *Sunny Home Manager*, but of course also consume electricity.

# Hardware

## Requirements

The *Smart Appliance Enabler* was implemented in **Java** and basically runs on any device for which a Java Virtual Machine with Java 11 exists. In addition to the compiled code, various scripts are provided in which **Linux** is assumed to be the operating system. If devices are to be connected via [GPIO](https://www.itwissen.info/GPIO-general-purpose-input-output.html), the *Smart Appliance Enabler* requires a [**Raspberry Pi**]( doc/Raspberry_EN.md) as hardware.

## Electricity meter

The *Smart Appliance Enabler* currently supports the following options for measuring the power consumption of a device in order to report it to the *Sunny Home Manager*:

# Assembly

If the *Smart Appliance Enabler* is to be operated on a Raspberry Pi, the [Assembly Instructions](doc/Assembly_EN.md) should be observed.

# Installation / Update

The [standard installation](doc/Installation_EN.md) runs automatically and requires no Linux knowledge.

If necessary, the [manual installation](doc/InstallationManual_EN.md) can also be selected as an alternative, in which all commands in the documentation must be executed manually.

[Installing updates](doc/Update_EN.md) enables the use of new functions and bug fixes.

<a href="doc/Docker_EN.md"><img align="left" src="pics/Docker.png"></a>If desired, the *Smart Appliance Enabler* can also be operated in a container with the provided [Docker-Images](doc/Docker_EN.md).<br><br>

# Configuration and Control

The [configuration](doc/Configuration_EN.md) of the *Smart Appliance Enabler* is done with the **web browser**.

The status of all controllable devices is clearly displayed in the [Status display](doc/Status_EN.md), whereby the status of each device is visualized by a **traffic light**. The traffic light can also be used for **manual control**.

<a><img align="left" src="pics/mqtt-logo.png"></a>
In addition, the *Smart Appliance Enabler* supports [Node-RED by exporting flows for the configured devices so that they can be visualized in the Node-RED dashboard](doc/NodeRED_EN.md). In addition, the [MQTT messages of the *Smart Appliance Enabler*](doc/MQTT_EN.md) can be used to integrate with other automation platforms.

In the following video you can get an impression of the configuration of the *Smart Appliance Enabler*. This video was created as part of conducting automated tests to ensure the quality of the *Smart Appliance Enabler*.
